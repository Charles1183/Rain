To launch the game 
The Rain program was the result of a Youtube game programming tutorial 
I went through during my junior year of college.
The tutorial was a set of videos created by The Cherno which can be 
found on his Youtube channel TheChernoProject at https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject.
The goal of taking the tutorial was to get better at Java programing 
as a result the game is not complete.
It consists of only one level and three mods not including 
the player controlled character.
Each of these mods demonstrate three different types of enemy behavior which are:
	-Random movement around the map
	-Targeting and shooting at the player
	-Following the player when the player gets close enough to the mod
The grey area on the right of the screen that reads HELLO!! is the starting 
of an in game menu which is not complete.

Controls:
+Movement
	A - left
	D - right
	W - up
	S - down
	(You can also use the directional keys on the keyboard to move around.)
+Shooting 
(Shooting is done using the mouse.)
	right click - shoots projectiles
	mouse pointer - aims projectiles.

**Side Notes: Conclusion detection only applies to the walls which are the grey brick tiles on the map.
This means that you cannot hit enemies with projectiles or be hit by enemy projectiles.
Other more technical notes can be found as comments in the source code.
